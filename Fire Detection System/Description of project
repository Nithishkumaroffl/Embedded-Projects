As a tech enthusiast passionate about practical problem-solving, I recently embarked on an exciting project to build a fire detection system using an Arduino, a flame sensor module, and a few essential components like LEDs and a buzzer.

This project combines electronics, programming, and real-world application—a perfect learning experience for anyone diving into embedded systems or IoT.
